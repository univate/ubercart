UBERCART README

Ubercart is a set of modules designed to allow you to run a store on your Drupal site.  Development has been driven by two major emphases: flexibility and usability.  The various systems driving Ubercart, including the product catalog, shopping cart and checkout, order, shipping, and payment systems have all been designed to be extended to meet any need.  Furthermore, the administrative interface, particularly relating to processing and fulfilling orders, has been designed for ease of use and efficient display of information.

Ubercart is being sponsored and developed by the team at http://www.ubercart.org.  Sign up for site access to join the Ubercart community and take advantage of our forums and issue tracking.
