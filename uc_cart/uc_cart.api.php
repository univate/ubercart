/**
 * Do extra processing when an item is added to the shopping cart.
 *
 * Some modules need to be able to hook into the process of adding items to a
 * cart. For example, an inventory system may need to check stock levels and
 * prevent an out of stock item from being added to a customer's cart. This hook
 * lets developers squeeze right in at the end of the process after the product
 * information is all loaded and the product is about to be added to the cart.
 * In the event that a product should not be added to the cart, you simply have
 * to return a failure message described below. This hook may also be used simply
 * to perform some routine action when products are added to the cart.
 *
 * @param $nid
 *   The node ID of the product
 * @param $qty
 *   The quantity being added
 * @param $data
 *   The data array, including attributes and model number adjustments
 * @return
 *   The function can use this data to whatever purpose to see if the item can
 *   be added to the cart or not. The function should return an array containing
 *   the result array. (This is due to the nature of Drupal's module_invoke_all()
 *   function. You must return an array within an array or other module data will
 *   end up getting ignored.) At this moment, there are only three keys:
 *   - "success": TRUE or FALSE for whether the specified quantity of the item
 *       may be added to the cart or not; defaults to TRUE.
 *   - "message": the fail message to display in the event of a failure; if
 *       omitted, Ubercart will display a default fail message.
 *   - "silent": return TRUE to suppress the display of any messages; useful
 *       when a module simply needs to do some other processing during an add to
 *       cart or fail silently.

/**
 * Control the display of an item in the cart.
 *
 * Product type modules allow the creation of nodes that can be added to the
 * cart. The cart determines how they are displayed through this hook. This is
 * especially important for product kits, because it may be displayed as a single
 * unit in the cart even though it is represented as several items.
 *
 * @param $item
 *   The item in the cart to display.

 *     - #value: The node id of the $item.
 *   - "module"
 *     - #type: value
 *     - #value: The module implementing this hook and the node represented by
 *       $item.
 *   - "remove"
 *     - #type: checkbox
 *     - #value: If selected, removes the $item from the cart.
 *   - "description"
 *     - #type: markup
 *     - #value: Themed markup (usually an unordered list) displaying extra information.
 *   - "title"
 *     - #type: markup
 *     - #value: The displayed title of the $item.
 *   - "#total"
 *     - "type": float
 *     - "value": Numeric price of $item. Notice the '#' signifying that this is
 *       not a form element but just a value stored in the form array.
 *   - "data"
 *     - #type: hidden
 *     - #value: The serialized $item->data.
 *   - "qty"
 *     - #type: textfield
 *     - #value: The quantity of $item in the cart. When "Update cart" is clicked,
 *         the customer's input is saved to the cart.

/**
 * Add extra data about an item in the cart.
 *
 * Products that are added to a customer's cart are referred as items until the
 * sale is completed. Just think of a grocery store having a bunch of products
 * on the shelves but putting a sign over the express lane saying "15 Items or
 * Less." hook_cart_item() is in charge of acting on items at various times like
 * when they are being added to a cart, saved, loaded, and checked out.
 *
 * Here's the rationale for this hook: Products may change on a live site during
 * a price increase or change to attribute adjustments. If a user has previously
 * added an item to their cart, when they go to checkout or view their cart
 * screen we want the latest pricing and model numbers to show. So, the essential
 * product information is stored in the cart, but when the items in a cart are
 * loaded, modules are given a chance to adjust the data against the latest settings.
 *
 * @param $op
 *   The action that is occurring. Possible values:
 *   - "load" - Passed for each item when a cart is being loaded in the function
 *       uc_cart_get_contents(). This gives modules the chance to tweak information
 *       for items when the cart is being loaded prior to being view or added to
 *       an order. No return value is expected.
 *   - "can_ship" - Passed when a cart is being scanned for items that are not
 *       shippable items. Ãœbercart will bypass cart and checkout operations
 *       specifically related to tangible products if nothing in the cart is
 *       shippable. hook_cart_item functions that check for this op are expected
 *       to return TRUE or FALSE based on whether a product is shippable or not.
 * @return
 *   No return value for load.
 *   TRUE or FALSE for can_ship.

 *
 * The body gets printed to the screen if it is on the cart view page.  For the
 * settings page, the body field is ignored.  You may want your function to check
 * for a NULL argument before processing any queries or foreach() loops.

 * functions. Some of the settings for each pane are configurable from the checkout
 * settings page with defaults being specified in the hooks.
