/**
 * Used to define line items that are attached to orders.
 *
 * A line item is a representation of charges, fees, and totals for an order.
 * Default line items include the subtotal and total line items, the tax line
 * item, and the shipping line item. There is also a generic line item that store
 * admins can use to add extra fees and discounts to manually created orders.
 * Module developers will use this hook to define new types of line items for
 * their stores. An example use would be for a module that allows customers to
 * use coupons and wants to represent an entered coupon as a line item.
 *
 * Once a line item has been defined in hook_line_item, Übercart will begin
 * interacting with it in various parts of the code. One of the primary ways this
 * is done is through the callback function you specify for the line item.
 *
 * @return
 *   Your hook should return an array of associative arrays. Each item in the
 *   array represents a single line item and should use the following keys:
 *   - "id"
 *     - type: string
 *     - value: The internal ID of the line item.
 *   - "title"
 *     - type: string
 *     - value: The title of the line item shown to the user in various interfaces.
 *         Use t().
 *   - "callback"
 *     - type: string
 *     - value: Name of the line item's callback function, called for various
 *         operations.
 *   - "weight"
 *     - type: integer
 *     - value: Display order of the line item in lists; "lighter" items are
 *         displayed first.
 *   - "stored"
 *     - type: boolean
 *     - value: Whether or not the line item will be stored in the database.
 *         Should be TRUE for any line item that is modifiable from the order
 *         edit screen.
 *   - "add_list"
 *     - type: boolean
 *     - value: Whether or not a line item should be included in the "Add a Line
 *         Item" select box on the order edit screen.
 *   - "calculated"
 *     - type: boolean
 *     - value: Whether or not the value of this line item should be added to the
 *         order total. (Ex: would be TRUE for a shipping charge line item but
 *         FALSE for the subtotal line item since the product prices are already
 *         taken into account.)
 *   - "display_only"
 *     - type: boolean
 *     - value: Whether or not this line item is simply a display of information
 *         but not calculated anywhere. (Ex: the total line item uses display to
 *         simply show the total of the order at the bottom of the list of line
 *         items.)

/**
 * Perform actions on orders.
 *
 * An order in Übercart represents a single transaction. Orders are created
 * during the checkout process where they sit in the database with a status of In
 * Checkout. When a customer completes checkout, the order's status gets updated
 * to show that the sale has gone through. Once an order is created, and even
 * during its creation, it may be acted on by any module to connect extra
 * information to an order. Every time an action occurs to an order, hook_order()
 * gets invoked to let your modules know what's happening and make stuff happen.
 *
 * @param $op
 *   The action being performed.
 * @param &$arg1
 *   This is the order object or a reference to it as noted below.
 * @param $arg2
 *   This is variable and is based on the value of $op:
 *   - new: Called when an order is created. $arg1 is a reference to the new
 *       order object, so modules may add to or modify the order at creation.
 *   - save: When an order object is being saved, the hook gets invoked with this
 *       op to let other modules do any necessary saving. $arg1 is a reference to
 *       the order object.
 *   - load: Called when an order is loaded after the order and product data has
 *       been loaded from the database. Passes $arg1 as the reference to the
 *       order object, so modules may add to or modify the order object when it's
 *       loaded.
 *   - submit: When a sale is being completed and the customer has clicked the
 *       Submit order button from the checkout screen, the hook is invoked with
 *       this op. This gives modules a chance to determine whether or not the
 *       order should be allowed. An example use of this is the credit module
 *       attempting to process payments when an order is submitted and returning
 *       a failure message if the payment failed.
 *
 *       To prevent an order from passing through, you must return an array
 *       resembling the following one with the failure message:
 *       @code
 *         return array(array('pass' => FALSE, 'message' => t('We were unable to process your credit card.')));
 *       @endcode
 *   - can_update: Called before an order's status is changed to make sure the
 *       order can be updated. $arg1 is the order object with the old order
 *       status ID ($arg1->order_status), and $arg2 is simply the new order
 *       status ID. Return FALSE to stop the update for some reason.
 *   - update: Called when an order's status is changed. $arg1 is the order
 *       object with the old order status ID ($arg1->order_status), and $arg2 is
 *       the new order status ID.
 *   - can_delete: Called before an order is deleted to verify that the order may
 *       be deleted. Returning FALSE will prevent a delete from happening. (For
 *       example, the payment module returns FALSE by default when an order has
 *       already received payments.)
 *   - delete: Called when an order is deleted and before the rest of the order
 *       information is removed from the database. Passes $arg1 as the order
 *       object to let your module clean up it's tables.
 *   - total: Called when the total for an order is being calculated after the
 *       total of the products has been added. Passes $arg1 as the order object.
 *       Expects in return a value (positive or negative) by which to modify the
 *       order total.
